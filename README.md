# Chutes-and-Ladder
Small board game 
the game "Chutes & Ladders". The board has squares which are numbered from 1 to 100 and players have counters which start on the theoretical square 0. The players take turns at spinning a spinner with the numbers 1 to 6 on it, and each moves his or her counter forward the number of squares corresponding to the number on the spinner. The first person to reach square 100 is the winner.

The interest is caused by the fact that pairs of squares are connected together by "ladders" (which connect a lower-numbered square to a higher-numbered square) 
and "chutes" (which run from high to low). 
If a counter lands on the start of a chute or ladder the counter is moved to the corresponding square at the end of the chute or ladder. 
Note that landing on the end square of a ladder or a chute has no effect, only the start square counts. If a player is on square 95 or higher, 
then a spin which takes them past 100 must be ignored - thus a player on square 99 must ignore all spins which are not 1.
